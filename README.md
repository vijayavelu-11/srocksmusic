Architectural Approach
MVVM with Provider
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern:

Model: music_service.dart defines the data structure

View: Screens in views/ and widgets in widgets/ handle UI presentation

ViewModel: music_service_view_model.dart contains business logic and state management

Provider is used to manage application state and facilitate communication between layers.

Data Flow
Firebase Service: Handles all Firebase interactions

Repository: Abstracts data sources (Firebase) from the rest of the app

ViewModel: Processes data from repository and provides it to views

View: Displays data and captures user interactions

Key Features
Clean separation of concerns

Scalable architecture for future features

Reusable UI components

Centralized state management

Abstracted data layer for easy source switching

Getting Started
Set up Firebase project and add configuration files

Run flutter pub get to install dependencies

Implement your Firebase service methods

The app is ready to run with flutter run

This structure provides a solid foundation for expanding the music services app with additional features while maintaining code organization and testability.
